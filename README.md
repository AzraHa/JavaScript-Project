<b>Game rules</b>
<p>The game consists of a 5x5 board containing 25 cards.<br>
 Two players are played alternately.
 The player on the move chooses one card. Below each card is a number from 1 to 1 0,
which is assigned by random selection. Players select cards until someone reaches 50
points. <br>
 After opening one of the cards, the player who is on the move is added to the sum
points scored behind the open card. The card is then closed. Number
that was behind that card remains behind it as many times as the sum of the rows and columns in which it is
finds the selected card. 
Once that number (the sum of the rows and columns) is reached, that card gets
new number.<br>
 In addition, in some places on the board, there are two special fields: smiley and
sad face. If a player opens the smiley field, then that player's points are scored
redouble. If the player opens the field where sad face is, then the player who played that move loses all points, and from that moment on the game resumes with 0 points. 
 After opening
smiley or sad face, a new number is dialed behind the card, while the smiley and sad face switch to another (random)
position. Initially, the board contains 4 smiles and 4 sad faces.</p>
